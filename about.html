        My name is Anna and I'm from Averill Park, New York. I transferred to New Paltz after attending Hudson Valley Community College where I received an Associates Degree in Business. 
        After Hudson Valley, I transfrered to New Paltz where I declared Geography as my major. As part of my Geography major, I have a concentration in Urban Planning. I intend to graduate New Paltz in May of 2025.
        I decided to try Geography because my dad was also a Geography major and I was also facinated by what he did.
